<h1>How to Setup the Project</h1>
<hr>

<h2>XAMPP Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Install XAMPP using this link: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html</li>
  <li>Navigate to /xampp/htdocs/ through your pc and move the "Gomoku-Game-Project" folder into htdocs</li>
  <li>Run APACHE and MySQL on the XAMPP Control Panel</li>
</ul>
From here you should be set to play offline. However, if you'd like to create accounts, login, and record your stats you will need to create a Database.

<h2>Database Creation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Once Apache and MySQL are running in the XAMPP Control Panel. Click on "admin" for MySQL</li>
  <li>Once on the MySQL page (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/). Click on the "User Accounts" tab</li>
  <li>Click on "Add user account" then create the following account with Global Privileges</li>
</ul>
User name: AdminLab12 <br>
Host name: Select "local"<br>
Password: 4VPnroTOC6wOU3mn<br>
(From here if you haven't done so already, click "Check all" for global privileges)<br>

<h3>Once finished</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Go to: http://localhost/Gomoku-Game-Project/index.php</li>
  <li>Click on the "Create DB" button" and you're set to go!</li>
</ul>
